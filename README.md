# mw-toolbox

some tools to interact with http://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/de/wiki/ needed by the maintenance bot.

uses limited editing rate of ~1-2 edits per second according to fandoms rules

Interaction with Riot's API only with "riot-api" feature flag (just "update rotation" for now) - enabled by default

-   CLI usage (development):
    -   run via "cargo run \<command\>"
        -   these commands need FANDOM_BOT_NAME, FANDOM_BOT_PASSWORD and RIOT_API_KEY (if needed) environment variables.
            -   Fandom login credentials can be alternatively provided via:
                -   "cargo run [--loginname \<name\>|-n \<name\>] and [--loginpassword \<pw\>|-p \<pw\>]"
            -   The login creds needs to be generated via Special:BotPasswords
